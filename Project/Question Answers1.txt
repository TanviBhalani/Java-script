33.Arithmetic Operator.
-> ( +, -, *, /, %, **, ++, --, ) are Arithmetic Operators.

-> Addition (+): 
   let result = 5 + 3; // result is 8


-> Subtraction (-):
   let result = 10 - 4; // result is 6


-> Multiplication (*):
   let result = 6 * 2; // result is 12


-> Division (/): 
   let result = 15 / 3; // result is 5


-> Remainder (%):
   let result = 10 % 3; // result is 1 (10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1)


-> Exponentiation (**):
   let result = 2 ** 3; // result is 8 (2 * 2 * 2)


-> Increment (++):
   let x = 5;
   let y = ++x; // x is 6, y is 6 (prefix: increments then assigns) 


-> Decrement (--):
   let x = 5;
   let y = --x; // x is 4, y is 4




34. Comparison Operator:
-> (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, ===, !==) are Comparison Operator

-> Loose Equality (==): (It checks only values)
   console.log(5 == "5"); // true (string "5" is coerced to number 5)


-> Strict Equality (===): (It checks both values and datatype)
   console.log(5 === "5"); // false (number and string are different types)


-> Loose Inequality (!=): (Checks if two values are not equal)
   console.log(5 != "6"); // true


-> Strict Inequality (!==): 
   console.log(5 !== "5"); // true


-> Greater than (>): 
   console.log(10 > 5); // true


-> Less than (<):
   console.log(5 < 10); // true	


-> Greater than or equal to (>=): 
   console.log(10 >= 10); // true


-> Less than or equal to (<=):
   console.log(5 <= 10); // true





35. Logical Operator:
-> (&&, ||, !, ??) are Logical Operator.


-> Logical AND (&&):
◻️ Returns true if both operands are truthy.

    console.log(true && true);   // true
    console.log(true && false);  // false
    console.log(false && true);  // false
    console.log(1 && 0);         // 0 (short-circuits)
    console.log("hello" && 123); // 123




-> Logical OR (||):
◻️ Returns true if at least one operand is truthy.


    console.log(true || true);    // true
    console.log(true || false);   // true
    console.log(false || true);   // true
    console.log(false || false);  // false
    console.log(0 || 1);          // 1 (short-circuits)
    console.log("" || "default"); // "default"



-> Logical NOT (!):
◻️ Reverses the Boolean value of its single operand.


    console.log(!true);   // false
    console.log(!false);  // true
    console.log(!0);      // true
    console.log(!"hello"); // false



-> Nullish Coalescing Operator (??):
◻️ Returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is null or undefined.


    console.log(null ?? "default");      // "default"
    console.log(undefined ?? "default"); // "default"
    console.log(0 ?? "default");         // 0
    console.log("" ?? "default");        // ""






36. Assignment Operator:
-> (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, &&= , ||=, ??=)


-> = (Assignment):
    let x = 10; // Assigns the value 10 to x



->  += (Addition Assignment):
    let x = 5;
    x += 3; // x is now 8 (equivalent to x = x + 3)



->  -= (Subtraction Assignment):
    let x = 10;
    x -= 4; // x is now 6 (equivalent to x = x - 4)



->  *= (Multiplication Assignment): 
    let x = 2;
    x *= 5; // x is now 10 (equivalent to x = x * 5)



->  /= (Division Assignment): 
    let x = 10;
    x /= 2; // x is now 5 (equivalent to x = x / 2)



->  %= (Remainder Assignment):
    let x = 10;
    x %= 3; // x is now 1 (equivalent to x = x % 3)



->  **= (Exponentiation Assignment):
    let x = 2;
    x **= 3; // x is now 8 (equivalent to x = x ** 3)

-> Object

38. What is == ?
-> This compare Values.

39. What is === ? 
-> This compares values and datatype both.

40. How Symbol is written?
-> let sym = Symbol("sym");

41. Syntax of Template literals.

->  const name = 'Tanvi';
   console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // → Hello, Tanvi!

42. Boolean values in JS?
->  true and false

43. Falsy values in JS?

-> false
   0
   ""
   null
   undefined
   NaN

44. Truthy values?
    Everything else except falsy values.

45. How do you create a string?
    Using single ('), double ("), or backtick (`) quotes.

46. What is Bigint Datatype?
-> This data type is used to store numbers which are above the limitation of the Number data type.(Big Integer)

    var bigInteger =  234567890123456789012345678901234567890;

47. In how many ways we can declare variables in JavaScript?
->  In JavaScript, there are three ways in which we can declare variables:
    1. Let    2.Var    3.Const
